# Theory of Computation

## Theory of computation, also known as Automata theory is a branch of computer science which deals with simple machines.
## This project consists of python programs to perform various algorithms such as subset construction, lazy evaluation, table filling algorithm and even simulate your own DFA!  
**Requirements:**  
>python3, pickle library  

**How to run?**  
>edit the 'input1.dfa' file and maintain the syntax as is  

**Use command line arguments as follows:**  
```
python3 DFA_Designer <input text file name> <output binary file name>
python3 DFA_Tester <input binary file name>
python3 DFA_Minimizer <input binary file name> <output text file name>
python3 DFA_Equivalence_Checker <input binary name 1> <input binary name 2>
python3 NFA_to_DFA <input text file name> <output text file name>
python3 ENFA_to_DFA <input text file name> <output text file name>
```
